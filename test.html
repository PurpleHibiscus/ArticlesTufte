Pauli’s exclusion principle shows that the fermionic particles in sufficiently compressed matter would be forced into energy states so high that their rest mass contribution would become negligible when compared with the relativistic kinetic contribution. RKC is determined just by the relevant quantum wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, which would be of the order of the mean interparticle separation. The corresponding pressure can be given by<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\displaystyle P={\frac {1}{\lambda ^{4}}}}.\]</span> That pressure must be balanced by the pressure needed to resist gravity. The pressure to resist gravity for a body of mass M will be given according to the virial theorem roughly by <span class="math display">\[P^{3}=M^{2}\rho ^{4},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the density. This will be given by <span class="math inline">\(\rho=m/\lambda^3\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the relevant mass per particle. The existence of the mass limit therefore comes from merging the two equations : <span class="math display">\[{\displaystyle M_{lim}={\frac {1}{m^{2}}}}\]</span> From this, m can be taken to be given roughly by the neutron mass. In the white dwarf case (that of the Chandrasekhar limit) for which the fermionic particles providing the pressure are electrons.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Therefore, since the mass of the electron is roughly 2000<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> times smaller than that of the proton, <em>the mass limit of the white dwarf will be higher than for a neutron star.</em><br />
